import { EndpointCard } from "../../components/fragments/endpoint-card.tsx";

In Vrite, **content groups** are used to group [content pieces](/docs#using-api-content-pieces) together, for the purpose of better content management and more organized content delivery. In the kanban UI a content group is equivalent to a **single column**.

## Retrieve All Content Groups

Retrieves all content groups with their names and IDs.

<EndpointCard
  client:only
  method="GET"
  endpoint="/content-groups/list"
  responseExamples={[
    {
      data: [
        { id: "63efc451cf034ba9ca007e47", name: "Drafts" },
        { id: "63efc450cf054bc9fa007e47", name: "Published" }
      ],
      name: "Success",
      id: "success"
    },
    {
      data: {
        message: "unauthorized",
        code: "UNAUTHORIZED"
      },
      name: "Unauthorized",
      id: "unauthorized"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Create or Update Content Group

Provided an ID and additional data, updates the content group's name. If no matching group is found, or no ID is provided, a new one is created.

<EndpointCard
  client:only
  method="PUT"
  endpoint="/content-groups"
  body={{
    schema: "/content-groups/schema",
    example: {
      id: "63efc451cf034ba9ca007e47",
      name: `Work In Progress`
    }
  }}
  responseExamples={[
    {
      data: { id: "63efc451cf034ba9ca007e47" },
      name: "Success",
      id: "success"
    },
    {
      data: {
        message: "Input validation failed",
        code: "BAD_REQUEST",
        issues: [
          {
            code: "invalid_type",
            expected: "string",
            received: "undefined",
            path: ["name"],
            message: "Required"
          }
        ]
      },
      name: "Bad request",
      id: "bad-request"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Delete Content Group

Provided an ID, deletes the content group and returns its ID. If no matching column is found (and deleted) it returns `null`.

<EndpointCard
  client:only
  method="DELETE"
  endpoint="/content-groups"
  parameters={[
    { name: "id", type: "string", description: "ID of the content group to remove", required: true }
  ]}
  responseExamples={[
    {
      data: { id: "63efc451cf034ba9ca007e47" },
      name: "Success",
      id: "success"
    },
    {
      data: {
        message: "Input validation failed",
        code: "BAD_REQUEST",
        issues: [
          {
            validation: "regex",
            code: "invalid_string",
            message: "invalid id",
            path: ["id"]
          }
        ]
      },
      name: "Bad request",
      id: "bad-request"
    }
  ]}
/>
