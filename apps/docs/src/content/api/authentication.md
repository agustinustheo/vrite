Vrite uses **Bearer Tokens**, passed through the `Authorization` header to authenticate you for API access:

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
```

If you haven't already, you can create an authentication token for your account in [the settings](https://docs.vrite.io/usage-guide/configuring-vrite/#creating-and-updating-api-tokens).
